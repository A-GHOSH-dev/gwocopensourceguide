          <p>Python can be described as a first programming language that is easy for people to pick up quickly. Developed in the 80’s by Guido van Rossum, he handed over the language to the non-profit Python Software Foundation. This foundation serves as the administrator of the language. The language is open source and is free to use even for commercial application. Usually used as a scripting language, programmers can easily produce large quantities of readable as well as functional code in a short period.

            Features associated with Python:
            It is an interpreted and object-oriented programming language
            Similar to PERL, It has gained popularity because of its clear syntax as well as readability
            It is portable – thus it can be interpreted in a number of operating systems, including Unix based systems, various versions of Microsoft Windows 98, Mac OS, MS Dos and OS/2.
            The source code is open for modification and reuse
            Relatively easy learning curve
            Python has a very simple syntax and is an example of a FLOSS.
            It is a high level language that does not need compilation to binary
            It supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of implementing OOP.
            It can be imbedded in C and C++.</p>
