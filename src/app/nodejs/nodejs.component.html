          <p>Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser that is open-source. It's important to note that NodeJS is neither a framework nor a programming language. The majority of folks are perplexed and believe it is a framework or programming language. We frequently utilise Node.js to create back-end services such as APIs, Web Apps, and Mobile Apps. Large corporations like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and others use it in their production. Other programming languages can also be used to create back-end services, so what sets Node.js apart?

            It's simple to use and may be used for prototyping as well as agile development.
            It offers services that are both quick and scalable.
            Because it uses JavaScript everywhere, it's simple for a JavaScript programmer to use Node.js to create back-end services.
            Cleaner and more consistent source code.
            Open source library has a large ecosystem.
            Its nature is asynchronous or non-blocking. Easy Scalability: Node.js is preferred by developers because it allows for easy horizontal and vertical scaling of applications. During the application's scalability, we may also add more resources.
            Real-time web apps: If you're making a web app, you may use PHP instead of Node.js, and it will take the same amount of time. However, if you're doing a chat app or a gaming app, Node.js is far superior due to faster synchronisation. For Node.js programming, the event loop also prevents HTTP overload.
            Fast Suite: NodeJs runs on the V8 engine developed by Google. Event loop in NodeJs handles all asynchronous operation so NodeJs acts like a fast suite and all the operations can be done quickly like reading or writing in the database, network connection, or file system.
            Easy to learn and code: Because it uses JavaScript, NodeJs is simple to learn and code. You can quickly learn and build the application using NodeJS if you are a front-end developer with a decent understanding of JavaScript.
            Advantage of Caching: It allows you to cache a single module. The first module is cached in the application memory whenever it is requested, so you don't have to re-execute the code.
            Data Streaming: The HTTP request and response are treated separately in NodeJs. They are data streams, therefore processing a file at the time of loading will lower the overall time and make the data presentation in the form of transmissions faster. You may also stream audio and video files at breakneck speeds.
            Hosting: PaaS (Platform as a Service) and Heroku are two hosting platforms for NodeJS app deployment that are simple to use and trouble-free.
            Corporate Support: The majority of well-known organisations, such as Walmart, Paypal, Microsoft, and Yahoo, use NodeJS to construct their apps. Because NodeJS uses JavaScript, most businesses have merged their front-end and back-end teams into a single entity.</p>
