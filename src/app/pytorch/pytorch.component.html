          <p>PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, and is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. PyTorch was primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.

            Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface. A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot, Uber's Pyro, Hugging Face's Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, and Catalyst. PyTorch was initially built to be flexible and modular for research, with the stability and support needed for production deployment.
            PyTorch provides us a Python package for high-level features like tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and TorchScript for an easy transition between eager mode and graph mode and with the latest release of PyTorch, the framework provides graph-based execution, distributed training, mobile deployment, and quantization.
            
            PyTorch as a Python package provides two high-level features:
            
            Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU).
            Deep neural networks built on a type-based automatic differentiation system.
