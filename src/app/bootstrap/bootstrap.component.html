          <p>Bootstrap is a front-end component library used for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. Developers can work in HTML, CSS, and JS, and have access to jQuery plugins, Sass variables and mixins, prebuilt components, and more. Bootstrap contains CSS and JS-based design templates for buttons, typography, forms, navigation, and other interface components or projects. Bootstrap is designed for simplifying the development of informative web pages, and its primary purpose is to affect the color, size, font, and layout of web projects.
